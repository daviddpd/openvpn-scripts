# Pretty Simple BIRD OSPF Configuration File.
# Note, I believe vtnet0 must have an IP in the 10.231.8.0/21
# range, and it can't be .1
#
# Ideally, the subnet on an interface shouldn't be needed
# but had a lot of issues getting this to work.
# With it not on an interface, the static route needs to
# be advertised.
